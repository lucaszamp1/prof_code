        <p><h1>Sugar (maroon 5)</h1></p>
        <br>
        <p>Letra:</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I'm hurting, baby, I'm broken down<br>
I need your loving, loving<br>
I need it now<br>
When I'm without you, I'm something weak<br>
You got me begging, begging<br>
I'm on my knees<br>

I don't wanna be needing your love<br>
I just wanna be deep in your love<br>
And it's killing me when you're away<br>
Ooh, baby, 'cause I really don't care where you are<br>
I just wanna be there where you are<br>
And I gotta get one little taste<br>

Sugar, yes, please<br>
Won't you come and put it down on me?<br>
I'm right here, 'cause I need<br>
Little love and little sympathy<br>
Yeah, you show me good loving<br>
Make it alright<br>
Need a little sweetness in my life<br>
Sugar, yes, please<br>
Won't you come and put it down on me?<br>
        </p>

        <p><h1>Beliver - Imagine Dragons (João Faria Remix)</h1></p><br>
        <p>First things first
            I'ma say all the words inside my head<br>
            I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh<br>
            The way that things have been, oh-ooh<br>
            Second thing second<br>
            Don't you tell me what you think that I could be<br>
            I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh<br>
            The master of my sea, oh-ooh<br>
            I was broken from a young age<br>
            Taking my sulking to the masses<br>
            Writing my poems for the few<br>
            That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me<br>
            Singing from heartache from the pain<br>
            Taking my message from the veins<br>
            Speaking my lesson from the brain<br>
            Seeing the beauty through the...<br>
            Pain!<br>
            You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
            Pain!<br>
            You break me down and build me up, believer, believer<br>
            Pain!<br>
            Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain<br>
            My life, my love, my drive, it came from...<br>
            Pain!<br>
            You made me a, you made me a believer, believer</p><br>

        <p><h1>Lil Nas X - Old Town Road</h1></p><br>
        <p>Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road<br>
            I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more<br>
            I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road<br>
            I'm gonna ride (Kio, Kio) 'til I can't no more<br>
            I got the horses in the back<br>
            Horse tack is attached<br>
            Hat is matte black<br>
            Got the boots that's black to match<br>
            Riding on a horse, ha<br>
            You can whip your Porsche<br>
            I been in the valley<br>
            You ain't been up off the porch now<br>
            Can't nobody tell me nothing<br>
            You can't tell me nothing<br>
            Can't nobody tell me nothing<br>
            You can't tell me nothing<br>
            Riding on a tractor<br>
            Lean all in my bladder<br>
            Cheated on my baby<br>
            You can go and ask her<br>
            My life is a movie<br>
            Bull riding and boobies<br>
            Cowboy hat from Gucci<br>
            Wrangler on my booty<br>
